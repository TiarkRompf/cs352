<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, we will enrich the simple arithmetic expression language we defined in the first project.</p>

<p>At the end of the project, we will be able to parse full programs; the only things missing will be functions and arrays. Our parser will generate an intermediate representation in the form of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).</p>

<h2>Step 1: Getting Started</h2>

<p>The project has been designed and tested for Linux/Mac OS. If you only have Windows installed on your personal laptop, consider running Linux in a VM or using the lab machines for the project.</p>

<p>If you use remote access to work on your project, please use one of the lab machines pod1-1 to pod1-20 with the suffix cs.purdue.edu (e.g. pod1-1.cs.purdue.edu)</p>

<p>Download the skeleton file <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gesserte/cs352/project/proj2.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<pre>
tar xzvf proj2.tar.gz
cd proj2
</pre>

<h2>Step 2: Project Structure</h2>

<h3>Open Project in Your Favorite Scala IDE</h3>
<p>You can use your editor or IDE of choice. The <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala website</a> has instructions for a range of alternatives. If you are using Eclipse, you first need to generate an Eclipse project. Add a file <b>plugins.sbt</b> in the <b>project/</b> folder with the line: addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "5.2.1") and execute:
<pre>
sbt eclipse
</pre>

and then import the Project into Eclipse: <b>File > Import > Existing project into Workspace</b>. Select the root folder proj2 and hit <b>Finish</b>.</p>

<h3>Browse the Files</h3>

<p>A description of the different files is provided below. The files you need to complete are <b>Parser.scala</b>, <b>SemanticAnalyzer.scala</b>, <b>Interpreter.scala</b>, and <b>Compiler.scala</b>. Following the path of the first project, we are going to implement the parser step by step. Follow the comments in the code and find the <b>TODOs</b>. The other part are also independent and can be develop separately.</p>

<h3>src/main/scala/project2/Util.scala</h3>

<p>This file defines multiple classes that are used to generate the code and run it on your machine. Nothing needs to be modified, but it is recommanded to read it and have an idea of what is happening behind the scenes.</p>

<h3>gen/bootstrap.c</h3>

<p>As we are generating assembly code which is OS dependent, we are using GCC to do the heavy lifting for us. The boostrap file is a generic C file that is calling a function <b>entry_point</b> and is printing the result in <b>stdout</b>. Our compiler will generate the file <b>gen/gen.s</b> and will be assembled and bootstrapped by gcc:</p>

<pre>gcc bootstrap.c gen.s -o out</pre>

<p><b>out</b> will then print the result of our compiled expression.</p>

<h3>src/main/scala/project2/Main.scala</h3>

<p>The main function is defined in this file. The data flow in this file can be seen as:</p>

<pre>
Read from File / Read from Command Line -> Parser -> Semantic Analyzer -> Interpreter/Compiler
</pre>

<p>You will be implementing many different parsers in order to test them through the main function.</p>

<p>The AST generated will then go through the semantic analyzer. If there are no errors, then the code is going to be interpreted and then compiled. We provide you with one interpreter and one compiler. You will have to write one of each yourself.</p>

<p>As our language becomes more complex, it will become more useful to read the code from a source file. A folder with sample files <b>sample/</b> has been provided. Here some examples how to run the code:</p>

<pre>
sbt
> run sample/arithm.scala           ---> interpreter/compiler provided
> run sample/arithm.scala x86      ---> x86 compiler (your code)
> run sample/arithm.scala st_int   ---> stack interpreter (your code)
</pre>

<p>However, it is still possible to run code from the command line, as in project 1:</p>

<pre>
sbt
> run "val x = 5; x"
> run "val x = 5; x" x86
> run "val x = 5; x" st_int
</pre>

<h3>src/main/scala/project2/Parser.scala</h3>

<p>This class contains the definition of our intermediate language.</p>

<p>As we discussed in class, parsing the file one character at a time is not enough when we introduce more complex constructs. Also, our single digit numbers were a little bit limiting. The <b>Scanner</b> class defined in this file tokenizes the code. You will have to implement the <b>getNum</b> method. Check out the other methods implemented there, as they are going to be useful for the next part.</p>

<p>The rest of the file is the definition of each parser we are building, starting from a generic precedence arithmetic parser to the full language we want to target, including variables, if statements, and loops. What you have to do for this project is highlighted with TODOs in the code. We encourage you to read the comments and code carefully before proceeding.</p>

<h3>src/main/scala/project2/SemanticAnalyzer.scala</h3>

<p>While the parser is in charge of verifying that the input string follows the defined syntax, the semantic analyzer verifies that the program described is meaningful and follows the rules. For example:

<pre>
val x = 2; x = 5
</pre>

has a valid syntax. However 'val' is immutable: it is not allowed to be reassigned to.
</p>

<p>Here is a list of the semantic rules that need to be enforced:</p>
<ul>
 <li>unary operators supported "+", "-". Raise: undefined unary operator</li>
 <li>binary operators supported "+", "-", "/", "*". Raise: undefined binary operator</li>
 <li>boolean operators supported "==", "!=", "&lt=", "&gt=", "&lt", "&gt". Raise: undefined boolean operator</li>
 <li>'val' can not be assigned. Raise: reassignment to val</li>
 <li>identifier needs to be defined in the current scope before being used. Raise: undefined identifier</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that we allow a variable to be declared multiple times. The last definition will be used when a reference to it is found. In this case only a warning is raised.</p>

<h3>src/main/scala/project2/Interpreter.scala</h3>

<p>As we have seen in class, now that our programing language accepts more than just mathematical expressions, we need to define the required behavior of our language. An interpreter can be used to define this meaning. </p>

<p>We provide you with an interpreter that is fully functional. Your job is to complete the <b>Stack-based</b> interpreter.</p>

<h3>src/main/scala/project2/Compiler.scala</h3>

<p>In this file, one compiler emitting Scala-like code has already been implemented. You need to implement a second compiler that can convert our AST into x86_64 code.</p>

<p>In the previous project, we considered two different ways of generating the assembly code, each of which has pros and cons: <b>Stack-based</b> code, which is not very efficient, but can handle arbitrarily complex expressions; and <b>Register-based</b> code, which is efficient, but can not handle arbitrarily complex expressions. <b>For this assignment, we will use a register-based approach.</b></p>

<h3>src/test/scala/project2/*Test.scala</h3>

<p>These files contain some unit tests for the first parsers. You will have to write your own tests for the others. There are some functions given to you in order to make the implementation easier.</p>

<h2>Turnin</h2>
<p>You should turn in the <b>proj2</b> directory. Please run an 'sbt clean' before submitting.</p>

<p>
To turn in your project, make sure that you are in the directory that contains the <b>proj2</b> directory. Then, type the following:
</p>
<pre>
turnin -c cs352 -p proj2 proj2
</pre>
<p>To verify your turned-in work, do:</p>
<pre>
turnin -c cs352 -p proj2 -v
</pre>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your project will be tested against a set of unit tests. The weights of each task will be distributed as follow:</p>
