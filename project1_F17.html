</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The project has been designed and tested for Linux/Mac OS. If you do not own a personal laptop with these OS, you can use the labs machine for the project.</p>

<p>You can also access the machine remotely by following this <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/resources/facilities/remote-access.html#RShell">guide</a>.
You can use the computers pod2-1, ...., pod2-10.cs.purdue.edu</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The goal of this project is to setup the environment and to learn how to parse and translate mathematical expressions into x86_64 assembly code. Our approach will be simple and the objective is to highlight some of the key aspects and ideas behind a compiler.</p>

<p>For this first project we are going to keep thing very simple and take very small steps. Make sure that you understand correctly before going to the next step.</p>

<p>We are going to start with simple expression and then add more operations. At the end of the project we will be able to parse mathematical expressions with single digit numbers, additions, substractions, multiplications, divisions, and parenthesis. We will generate x86_64 code that compute the value of the expression.</p>
</p>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>In addition of the comments in the code, we are going to make a small description of the files avaible in the project.</p>

<h3>build.sbt</h3>
<p>Scala Build Tool (sbt) is an open source build tool for Scala and Java project. This file contains the information necessary to compile this project. You should not have to modify it.

<p>To use sbt, launch a terminal and go to the project directory (proj1) and type 'sbt'. It will lauch an sbt console:
<pre>
    run "arg1" "arg2" // run main program with arguments arg1 and arg2
    run "1+3*(5-8)"
    test              // run all the tests application (in src/test)
</pre>


<h3>src/main/scala/project1/Util.scala</h3>

<p>This file defined multiple classes that are used by our parser to generate the code and run it on your machine. Nothing needs to be modified, but it is recommanded to read the code and have an idea of what is happening behind the scene.</p>

<h3>gen/bootstrap.c</h3>

<p>Like we are generating assembly code which is OS dependent, we are using GCC to do the heavy lifting for us. The boostrap file is a generic C file that is calling a function <b>entry_point</b> and print the result in <b>stdout</b>. Our compiler will generate the file <b>gen/gen.s</b> and will be assemble and bootstraped by gcc:</p>

<pre>gcc bootstrap.c gen.s -o out</pre>

<p><b>out</b> will then print the result of our compiled expression.</p>

<p>NOTE: the compilation and running steps are executed through the code. (see Util.scala#L77 and Main.scala#L35)</p>

<h3>src/main/scala/project1/Main.scala</h3>

<p>The main function is defined in this file. During this project you will be implementing many different parsers, in order to test them through the main function you will need to modify the generator used at line 12:

<pre>val gen = new &ltgenerator to test&gt(reader) {</pre>

<h3>src/main/scala/project1/Project1.scala</h3>

<p>The first class defined in this file is the basic parser that we are going to use for this project. This parser is reading a stream of character one at a time and can extract a single digit number <b>getNum</b> or a single letter name <b>getName</b>.</p>

<p>We are keeping the parser very simple at the beginning to focus on the important concept. Later on we will improve it to handle multiple digits numbers and more expressions.</p>

<p>The rest of the file is the definition of each compilers we are building. Starting from single number expression to the full language we want to target. What you have to do for this project is highlighted with TODOs in the code. We encourage you to read the comments and code carefully before preceeding.</p>

<h3>src/test/scala/Project1Test.scala</h3>

<p>This file contains some unit tests for the first compilers. You will have to write your own test for the others. There are some function given to you in order to make the implementation easier.</p>

<h3>Turnin</h3>
<p>You should turn in just the <b>build.sbt</b> file, and the directories <b>src/</b> and <b>gen/</b>. Please delete the directories <b>target/</b> and <b>project/</b> (DO NOT DELETE YOU CODE!)
<pre>
rm -rf proj1/target/ proj1/project/
</pre>

</p><p>
To turn in your project, make sure that you are in the directory that contains <b>proj1</b> directory. Then type the following:
</p>
<pre>
turnin -c cs352 -p project1 proj1
</pre>
<p>To verify your turned-in work, do:</p>
<pre>
turnin -c cs352 -p project1 -v
</pre>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>TBD
