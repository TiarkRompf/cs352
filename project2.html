<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Implement a parser for the
<a href="mojo.html">Mojo language</a> using JavaCC.
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3> Begin first by extending your JavaCC scanner for Mojo
tokens from project 1 (if your scanner still needs more work please see the TA
and he will help you get it fixed).  Starting with your scanner, write JavaCC
grammar rules for Mojo.  Initially, your parser will simply take an input and
decide if it is a syntactically correct Mojo program.
<p>
Once you have this working you will then use your parser to construct
an <em>abstract syntax tree</em> (AST) for the input program.
<p>
Source code to get started with is available in the /homes/cs352/Fall15 directory. To copy the skeleton code into your project directory, start in your project directory and do:
<pre>
  cp /homes/cs352/Fall15/project2.tar.gz ./
  tar -xvf project2.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>
The files are actually configured as an Eclipse project, so you
can also import the project into Eclipse at your convenience. The bin subdirectory is where your .class files will be generated, and the src subdirectory is where you will place your .java files. You may make new .java files or use the included ones at your convenience. We have included a Makefile which targets the included .java files and cleans up the automatically generated javacc files in the src/mojo/parse directory.</p>
<p>
All commands below will assume that you have first set your current directory
to the <code>bin</code> subdirectory using the command:
<pre>
        cd bin
</pre>
<p>
The framework for building the AST (and printing out the results) is available
in <code>mojo/Absyn.java</code>.  You do not need to edit this file, but you
will be building the AST from the classes in this file. Note that the Abstract Syntax Tree implemented in Absyn.java utilizes the popular Visitor design pattern (see CS307).
<p>
You can run the parser and print out the AST it builds using the command:
<pre>
        java mojo.Absyn <i>file</i>.mj
</pre>
<p>
Before starting this project, familiarize yourself with Chapters 3 &amp; 4 of
the textbook. In addition to the lectures, this will give you a solid
foundation for starting your parser.
<p>
<h3>Turnin</h3>
<p>
You should turn in just your JavaCC file, which implements your parser, using
the <tt>turnin</tt> command available on CS Unix machines.
</p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
We will create a set of test cases, and then compare the output of your
solution to our reference implementation.  Grading test cases are intended to
test separable functionality of your parser.
<p>
There will be a <em>reconciliation</em> period after initial grading when you
will be able to compare outputs of your parser with those of the reference
implementation, and you may then offer <b>simple</b> fixes for the TAs to
apply to your implementation to improve your grade.  <b>These fixes will be
accepted only at the discretion of the TAs and the instructor (we will judge
what "simple" means!)</b>
<p>
The reconciliation period is only intended for you to be able to fix simple
problems that you may have mistakenly overlooked.  Thus, you must make sure to
test your implementation thoroughly.
