> Due 11:59pm Thursday Apr 4 (two and a half weeks project)

Download the skeleton code for the project
[here](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gao606/cs352/proj6.zip){:target="_blank"}.

Your task in this assignment is to implement a series of optimizations
for the CPS compiler. In the skeleton code you will find
`src/miniscala/CPSOptimizer.scala`. This file contains the
optimizer mechanism, followed by two specific instantiations:
`CPSOptimizerHigh` and `CPSOptimizerLow`. Your task is to
fill in the optimizer mechanism, which consists of shrinking and
non-shrinking optimizations (as described in the lectures) and the
specific implementation of `CPSOptimizerHigh`. The specific
implementation of `CPSOptimizerLow` is given.

More specifically, you are expected to implement:

-   Dead code elimination
-   Common-subexpression elimination
-   Constant folding
-   Neutral/absorbing elements optimization
-   Shrinking inlining
-   General inlining, according to a predetermined heuristics (see
    below: Notes on Implementation)

For bonus grade, you may implement:

-   Block primitive optimizations

For fun and fame (see optimization challenge), you may implement:

-   Any optimizations you can think about

Do not implement:

-   Î·-reduction
-   Contification (already implemented. Can be turned on by uncommenting
    line 49 in Main.scala. Careful the tests do not use it.)

Once the optimizer is fully functional, it should optimize the following
example correctly:

**Input:**

      def printChar(c: Int) = putchar(c);
      def functionCompose(f: Int => Int, g: Int => Int) = (x: Int) => f(g(x));
      def plus(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y;
      def succ(x: Int) = x + 1;
      def twice(x: Int) = x + x;
      printChar(functionCompose(succ,twice)(39));
      printChar(functionCompose(succ,succ)(73));
      printChar(functionCompose(twice,succ)(4));
      0

**Output:**

      vall t_2 = 79;
      valp t_3 = byte-write(t_2);
      vall t_5 = 75;
      valp t_6 = byte-write(t_5);
      vall t_8 = 10;
      valp t_9 = byte-write(t_8);
      vall t_11 = 0;
      halt(t_11)

Closures? Blocks? The optimizer eliminated all abstractions and gave us
the simplest inline code possible. :D
Now, to start hacking on the optimizer:

    cd proj6/compiler
    sbt
    > run ../library/miniscala.lib ../examples/pascal.scala
    ...

    Instruction Stats
    =================
        6205  LetP
        2998  LetL
        ...

The "Instruction stats" indicate **how many instructions were
executed** while computing the pascal triangle. This is in contrast to
the total instructions in the output program, which is constant
regardless of the input. NOTE: the number is when you use contification.

## Notes on Implementation

The implementation sketch that is given to you is not a trivial mapping
of the theory into code, so here are some notes to guide you through it.

The optimizations are split in shrinking (in method `shrink`) and
non-shrinking (or general inlining, in method `inline`)
optimizations. Remember that shrinking optimizations are safe to apply
as often as desired, while inlining may lead to arbitrarily large code,
or even diverge the optimizer.

The general idea of the optimizer (see method `apply`) is the
following: After an initial step of iteratively applying `shrink`
until a fixed point, we iteratively apply a step of `inline` and a
step of `shrink` until one of the following happens:

-   The tree does not change
-   We reach a specified number of iterations, or
-   The resulting tree's size exceeds `maxSize`, given as a
    function of the initial size.
-   The two first conditions are checked by the `fixedPoint`
    function itself, while the third is checked within `inline`.

The `inline` function is actually a small series of inlining
steps. During each inlining step, we choose to inline
functions/continuations of increasing size. For continuations, this size
is linear to the number of steps, but for functions it is exponential
(according to the Fibonacci sequence). We stop inlining after a
specified number of steps, or if the tree grows to more than
`maxSize`.

The internal traversals of both the `shrink` and `inline`
functions accept an implicit argument of the `State` type, which,
as you may have guessed, tracks the local state of the optimization. You
are supposed to update it as you traverse the subtrees using the
designated methods. The descriptions in the source file will hopefully
make each field's role to the optimization clear.

## Testing

Testing will be slightly different this time. We have 3 sets of tests:

-   **Blackbox** tests check the program you output runs correctly,
    therefore the optimizations keep the semantics of the language (see
    `test/miniscala/test/CPSOptimizer_Blackbox.scala`)
-   **Greybox** tests execute the program while recording the execution
    trace and then require certain properties of the trace, such as, for
    example that at most 2 functions were defined (see
    `test/miniscala/test/CPSOptimizer_Greybox.scala` and the
    additions to `src/miniscala/CPSInterpreter.scala` for more
    details)
-   **Optimization challenge** allows showing off how good your
    optimizer is on larger applications: we will run an example
    application and output the execution statistics (see
    `src/miniscala/CPSInterpreter.scala`) -- you can compete with
    your colleagues and with our reference implementation to get the
    best results possible. And yes, you should brag about your results
    on Piazza!

This assignment gives you a lot of liberty into how and what you
optimize, so go ahead and write the best optimizer in the entire class!

## Turnin

You should turn in the **proj6** directory. Please run an 'sbt clean'
and './cleanall.sh' before submitting.

To turn in your project create a ZIP file named
`<purdueemailusername>-proj<N>.zip` of the `proj6` directory for
example `axhebraj-proj6.zip` and upload it to the corresponding
assignment on Brightspace.

## Challenge Results

For the reference compiler we have developed, the challenge results are
given below. Different results form these statistics are encouraged,
especially if they reduce the numbers in one category or the other.

NOTE: Turn on contification in order to improve your numbers.

    Challenge: maze.scala with 12 for both inputs.
